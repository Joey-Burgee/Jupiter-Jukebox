# Jupiter-Jukebox
This is a music streaming application made with Java.

I was unable to upload the .wav files required to run this program without errors (the file sizes were too large), but you can easily download the songs yourself. You will find the list of songs I used in Jukebox.java. You can either use the songs I chose, or you could update the lists of songs in Jukebox.java with the songs of your choosing.
